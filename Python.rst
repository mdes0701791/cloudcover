Python
======
Python is obviously a core competency and probably the big buzzword for the language to learn in the current decade.
There are LOTS of resources to choose and I'm trying out Udemy course that utilizes :term:`Jupyter` as a learning platform. Certainly there is plenty to choose from but I'll start listing out and curating a longer list of useful resources especially in particular for my cyber colleagues.

As there's still camps for which version (2 or 3) the default references here will be for Version 3. For anything referncing 2.7.x it will be explicitly tagged or mentioned.
