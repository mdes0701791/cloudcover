Tips, Tools and CheatSheets
---------------------------

* `Tutorialspoint <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/git/index.htm>`_ learning site that is basically a decent reference page on Git commands
* The official `Git CheatSheet <https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf>`_
* And a visual reference [ *just for BB8* ;-) ] of a `Git tutorial <https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html>`_
* This presentation is a bit more historical and technical but if you're into that stuff `here ya go <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pluralsight/git-internals-pdf/master/drafts/peepcode-git.pdf>`_
* `Git Everyday <https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/giteveryday.html>`_ is a quick reference guide that outlines 4 different types of roles for those who are working with git repositories.

Shortcuts
---------
Some extra stuff I learned that were not on the man or help pages:

git config
^^^^^^^^^^
Creating an alias::

      $git config --global alias.s "status"
